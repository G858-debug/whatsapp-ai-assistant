**Flow:**

1. Generate CSV content
2. Save to temporary file
3. Upload to Supabase Storage
4. Get public URL
5. Send as WhatsApp document
6. Clean up local file
7. Fallback to preview if any step fails

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket in Supabase

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**

- The code will automatically create the bucket on first use
- Bucket name: `csv-exports`
- Configuration: Public access enabled

**Option B: Manual**

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** section
3. Click **New Bucket**
4. Name: `csv-exports`
5. Check **Public bucket** ✅
6. Click **Create bucket**

### Step 2: Verify Bucket Permissions

1. In Supabase Dashboard → Storage → `csv-exports`
2. Click **Policies** tab
3. Ensure these policies exist:

**Policy 1: Public Read Access**

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public Access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING ( bucket_id = 'csv-exports' );
```

**Policy 2: Authenticated Upload**

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated Upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK ( bucket_id = 'csv-exports' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated' );
```

**Policy 3: Authenticated Delete**

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated Delete"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING ( bucket_id = 'csv-exports' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated' );
```

### Step 3: Test the Implementation

**Test with >5 connections:**

```python
# As trainer with 6+ clients
/view-trainees

# Expected result:
# ✅ Client List Sent!
# 📄 CSV file with 12 clients has been sent.
# Tap the document above to download.
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Upload Flow

```
1. User requests list (/view-trainees or /view-trainers)
   ↓
2. System checks count
   ↓
3. If >5: Generate CSV content
   ↓
4. Save to temp file
   ↓
5. Upload to Supabase Storage (csv-exports bucket)
   ↓
6. Get public URL
   ↓
7. Send via WhatsApp document API
   ↓
8. User receives downloadable file
   ↓
9. Clean up local temp file
```

### File Naming

**Format:**

- Clients: `clients_{trainer_id}_{timestamp}.csv`
- Trainers: `trainers_{client_id}_{timestamp}.csv`

**Example:**

- `clients_TRN123_20240115_143022.csv`
- `trainers_CLI456_20240115_143022.csv`

### Public URLs

**Format:**

```
https://{project_id}.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/csv-exports/{filename}
```

**Example:**

```
https://abcdefgh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/csv-exports/clients_TRN123_20240115_143022.csv
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before (Preview Only)

```
User: /view-trainees

Bot: 📋 Your Clients (12)

You have 12 clients.

CSV Preview (first 10 rows):
`Name,Client ID,Phone,Email...`
...

💡 Note: Full CSV file saved locally
```

### After (Downloadable File)

```
User: /view-trainees

Bot: [Sends CSV document]

Bot: ✅ Client List Sent!

📄 CSV file with 12 clients has been sent.

Tap the document above to download.
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Bucket Name

Default: `csv-exports`

To change:

```python
# In command handlers
storage_helper = SupabaseStorageHelper(db, bucket_name='my-custom-bucket')
```

### File Retention

Files are kept indefinitely by default.

To enable automatic cleanup:

```python
# Add to a scheduled job (e.g., daily cron)
from services.helpers.supabase_storage import SupabaseStorageHelper

storage_helper = SupabaseStorageHelper(db)
deleted_count = storage_helper.cleanup_old_files(days_old=7)
print(f"Cleaned up {deleted_count} old files")
```

---

## 🛡️ Security

### Public Access

- ✅ Files are publicly accessible via URL
- ✅ URLs are not guessable (includes timestamp)
- ✅ No authentication required to download
- ⚠️ Anyone with URL can download

### Best Practices

1. **File Naming:** Include user ID in filename for tracking
2. **Cleanup:** Regularly delete old files (7-30 days)
3. **Monitoring:** Log all uploads and downloads
4. **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse of CSV generation

### Optional: Signed URLs

For more security, use signed URLs with expiration:

```python
# In supabase_storage.py
def get_signed_url(self, filename: str, expires_in: int = 3600) -> str:
    """Get signed URL that expires"""
    return self.db.storage.from_(self.bucket_name).create_signed_url(
        filename,
        expires_in  # Seconds until expiration
    )
```

---

## 📋 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Bucket not created automatically

**Solution:**

```python
# Manually create bucket
from services.helpers.supabase_storage import SupabaseStorageHelper

storage_helper = SupabaseStorageHelper(db)
# Bucket will be created on initialization
```

### Issue: Upload fails with permission error

**Solution:**

1. Check Supabase service role key is correct
2. Verify bucket policies in Supabase Dashboard
3. Ensure bucket is set to public

### Issue: File not accessible via URL

**Solution:**

1. Verify bucket is public
2. Check file was uploaded successfully
3. Test URL in browser
4. Check Supabase Storage logs

### Issue: WhatsApp document send fails

**Solution:**

1. Verify URL is publicly accessible
2. Check WhatsApp API token is valid
3. Ensure file size is within limits (16MB for WhatsApp)
4. Check WhatsApp API logs

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Upload

```python
from services.helpers.supabase_storage import SupabaseStorageHelper

# Create test file
with open('/tmp/test.csv', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Name,Email\nJohn,john@email.com')

# Upload
storage_helper = SupabaseStorageHelper(db)
url = storage_helper.upload_csv('/tmp/test.csv', 'test.csv')

print(f"Public URL: {url}")
# Should print: https://...supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/csv-exports/test.csv
```

### Test Download

```bash
# Copy URL from upload test
curl "https://...supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/csv-exports/test.csv"

# Should output CSV content
```

### Test WhatsApp Delivery

```python
# With >5 connections
# As trainer: /view-trainees
# As client: /view-trainers

# Expected:
# 1. CSV document sent
# 2. Confirmation message
# 3. File downloadable in WhatsApp
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Uploaded Files

**Supabase Dashboard:**

1. Go to Storage → csv-exports
2. View all uploaded files
3. Check file sizes and dates

**Via Code:**

```python
storage_helper = SupabaseStorageHelper(db)
files = storage_helper.db.storage.from_('csv-exports').list()

for file in files:
    print(f"{file['name']} - {file['created_at']}")
```

### Storage Usage

**Check in Supabase Dashboard:**

- Storage → Usage
- Monitor total storage used
- Set up alerts for limits
