@claude @apply @sonnet Fix the deployment crash caused by missing icalendar module.

The error is: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'icalendar'

Add the missing dependency to requirements.txt:
- Add: icalendar==5.0.10

Make sure all imports in services/calendar_service.py are covered by requirements.txt.

Check if there are any other missing dependencies that might cause similar issues.
