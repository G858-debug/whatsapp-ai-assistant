@claude @apply Fix the registration confirmation step in services/refiloe_helpers.py. Currently when users type "edit" at the confirmation step, the system gets stuck.

Requirements:
1. In the _continue_registration method, add handling for the 'confirmation' step that recognizes "yes", "edit", and variations
2. Enhance _restart_registration to allow editing specific fields instead of starting over completely
3. When user types "edit", show them their current details and ask which specific field they want to change (name, business, location, or specialisation)

The goal is to let users fix mistakes without redoing the entire registration.
