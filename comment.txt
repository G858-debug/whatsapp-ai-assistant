Requirements:

1. Create services/calendar_export_service.py with:
   - generate_ics_file(booking_data)
   - create_calendar_invite(booking, attendees)
   - send_calendar_email(recipient, ics_attachment)
   - bulk_export_month(trainer_id, month, year)

2. ICS file generation should include:
   - VEVENT with proper formatting
   - DTSTART/DTEND with timezone
   - SUMMARY with session details
   - LOCATION (trainer's gym/online link)
   - DESCRIPTION with full details
   - ORGANIZER (trainer email)
   - ATTENDEE (client email)

3. Add export options to dashboard:
   - Export button on month view
   - Export formats: .ics, CSV, PDF
   - Email calendar to self option
   - Share calendar link option

4. Email integration for calendar invites:
   - Send invite when booking created
   - Send update when booking modified
   - Send cancellation when booking cancelled
   - Use proper iTIP/iMIP format

5. Add settings for email preferences:
   - Enable/disable automatic invites

Test that .ics files work with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Outlook.
