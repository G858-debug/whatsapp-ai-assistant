The RefiloeService class in services/refiloe.py is too large to edit directly. Please help me refactor it into smaller files:

Create services/refiloe_handlers.py with all the handle* methods
Create services/refiloe_helpers.py with helper methods like _get_user_context, _log_interaction, etc.
Keep the main process_message and init in services/refiloe.py
Import the methods from the new files
This will make the code more maintainable and editable.

@apply
