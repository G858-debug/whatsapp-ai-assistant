Update the dashboard backend (routes/dashboard.py or app.py) to support calendar views.

Requirements:

1. Add new API endpoints:
   - GET /api/dashboard/calendar/month - Get month view data
   - GET /api/dashboard/calendar/week - Get week view data  
   - GET /api/dashboard/calendar/day - Get day view data
   - POST /api/dashboard/calendar/preferences - Update view preferences
   - GET /api/dashboard/calendar/availability - Get trainer availability

2. Month view endpoint should return:
   - All bookings for the month
   - Formatted as: {date: [{client_abbrev, time, type, color}]}
   - Include session counts per day
   - Mark today's date

3. Week view endpoint should return:
   - 7 days of detailed bookings
   - Time slots from 6:00 to 20:00
   - Available vs booked slots

4. Day view endpoint should return:
   - Detailed session information
   - Client full names and contact
   - Session notes and history
   - Quick action buttons data

5. Add view preference management:
   - Store user's preferred view
   - Remember last viewed date
   - Color scheme preferences

Update the existing dashboard() function to include calendar data in the template context. Make sure all endpoints are secured with trainer authentication.
