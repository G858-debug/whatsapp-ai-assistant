@claude Implement client challenge participation.

Add to services/gamification.py:
- join_challenge() - client joins a challenge
- log_challenge_progress() - automatic tracking from habits/workouts
- get_my_challenges() - list client's active challenges
- calculate_points() - award points based on achievement

Integrate with existing habit tracking:
- When habits are logged, check active challenges
- Auto-update challenge_progress table
- Send encouraging messages for milestones

WhatsApp responses:
"ðŸŽ¯ Great job! You earned 25 points for today's workout!"
"ðŸ’ª You're 3rd on the leaderboard! Keep going!"
