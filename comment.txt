@claude @apply After all registration improvements, add comprehensive error handling and edge case management:

1. Add a registration timeout (clear registration_state if abandoned for >90 minutes)
2. Handle database errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
3. Add logging for all registration steps for debugging
4. Create a _handle_registration_error method that can gracefully recover from any error state
5. Add duplicate prevention (check if phone/email already registered)
6. Add a "help" command that works at any point in registration
7. Add ability to type "back" to go to previous step
8. Add ability to type "cancel" to abort registration

Ensure every possible user action has a helpful response and the system never gets "stuck".
