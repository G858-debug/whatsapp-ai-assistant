Add a day view to the dashboard that appears when clicking on a day in the month view.

Requirements:

1. Create a modal or slide-in panel for day view:
   - Shows when clicking a day in month view
   - Has a close button to return to month view
   - Shows full date at the top

2. Day view layout:
   - Time slots from 6:00 to 20:00 (30-min intervals)
   - Each session shows as a card with:
     - Time range
     - Client full name
     - Session type with color coding
     - Client phone number (tap to WhatsApp)
     - Quick actions (cancel, reschedule, notes)

3. Implement these interactions:
   - Click client name to view client details
   - Click phone to open WhatsApp
   - Swipe left to show quick actions (mobile)
   - Add new session button (opens WhatsApp to Refiloe)

4. Visual design:
   - Timeline view with sessions as blocks
   - Color-coded by session type
   - Available slots shown as "Add Session"
   - Smooth transitions between views

5. Data handling:
   - Fetch from /api/dashboard/calendar/day
   - Pass selected date as parameter
   - Update UI without page reload

Make it work seamlessly on mobile devices with touch gestures. Include proper loading states and error handling.
