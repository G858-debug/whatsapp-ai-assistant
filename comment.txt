@claude Act as multiple specialized agents to fix and optimize each of the following components. Integrate challenge progress tracking with existing habit and workout logging.

Modify existing services:

1. IN habits.py:
When log_habit_check() is called:
- Check active challenges for this user
- If habit matches challenge criteria, update challenge_progress
- Add points silently (include in daily digest)
- No immediate WhatsApp notification

2. IN workout_service.py:
When workout is completed:
- Check if user has workout-related challenges
- Auto-increment workout challenge progress
- Update dashboard in real-time
- Include achievement in next digest only

3. IN assessment_service.py:
When assessment improves:
- Check for improvement challenges
- Award bonus points for % improvements
- Create celebration message for daily digest
- Update dashboard stats immediately

4. CREATE challenge_progress_tracker.py:
- auto_track_progress(): Called by other services
- Maps activities to challenges:
  * Water logged → Hydration challenges
  * Steps logged → Step challenges
  * Workout done → Workout warrior
  * All habits logged → Consistency challenges
- Batch updates to reduce database calls
- Return points earned for digest

5. DASHBOARD REAL-TIME UPDATES:
- Progress bars update without refresh
- Points counter animates up
- Rank changes show immediately
- Confetti on challenge completion

No extra WhatsApp messages - everything accumulates for daily digest.
Dashboard shows real-time progress.
