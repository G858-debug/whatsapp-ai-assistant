@claude @apply Review the entire registration system (both trainer and client) and polish the user experience:

1. Make all messages friendly and encouraging
2. Use consistent emoji usage in message bodies (not in buttons)
3. CRITICAL: Ensure ALL button titles are under 20 characters (WhatsApp strict limit)
4. Add progress indicators (Step 1 of 6) in message text where appropriate
5. Make error messages helpful, not technical
6. Add personality to Refiloe's responses
7. Add celebration messages with emojis upon successful registration
8. Make the quick-start buttons after registration actually useful and under 20 chars

Focus on making the experience delightful, not just functional.
