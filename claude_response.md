## ANALYSIS
The Unicode escape syntax `\U0001F4B0` for the money bag emoji is causing a syntax error in the payment status message. We can replace it with the direct emoji character `ðŸ’°` for better readability and to avoid escape sequence issues.

## CHANGES NEEDED

### EDIT: services/refiloe.py

**Change 1:** Replace Unicode escape with direct emoji character
Location: Lines 461-468 (in _check_payment_status method)

```python
# REMOVE (lines 461-468):
                if outstanding.data:
                    total = sum(p['amount'] for p in outstanding.data)
                    message = f"""\U0001F4B0 *Payment Status*

Outstanding: R{total:.2f}

Contact your trainer for payment details."""

# ADD:
                if outstanding.data:
                    total = sum(p['amount'] for p in outstanding.data)
                    message = f"""ðŸ’° *Payment Status*

Outstanding: R{total:.2f}

Contact your trainer for payment details."""
```

## SUMMARY
- Replaced Unicode escape sequence `\U0001F4B0` with direct emoji character `ðŸ’°`
- Maintains exact same functionality but fixes syntax error
- Message formatting and structure remains unchanged
- Since this file is over 600 lines, it should be split into smaller modules in a future update

Note: The file services/refiloe.py should be split into smaller modules in a future task as it exceeds the 600-line limit. Consider separating it into logical components like:
- message_handler.py
- payment_handler.py
- habit_handler.py
- assessment_handler.py
