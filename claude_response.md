## ANALYSIS

Looking at the build logs, the error is clear: the build is failing because it's trying to install `numpy==1.24.3` which doesn't have pre-built wheels for Python 3.12, and during the source build it encounters `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'`. This is a common issue with Python 3.12 as `distutils` has been removed from the standard library.

The issue is in `requirements.txt` where we have:
- `numpy==1.24.3` - This version doesn't support Python 3.12
- `pandas==2.1.1` - This also needs to be updated for Python 3.12 compatibility

The solution is to update these packages to versions that support Python 3.12.

## SUMMARY

Fixed the Railway deployment build failure by:

1. **Updated numpy** from version 1.24.3 to 1.26.4 - this version has proper Python 3.12 support and pre-built wheels
2. **Updated pandas** from version 2.1.1 to 2.2.0 - this version is compatible with the updated numpy and Python 3.12
3. **Added runtime.txt** to specify Python 3.11.9 as a fallback option - Railway will use this Python version if specified, which ensures maximum compatibility with all packages

The root cause was that numpy 1.24.3 doesn't support Python 3.12 (which Railway uses by default). When pip tries to build numpy from source for Python 3.12, it fails because Python 3.12 removed the `distutils` module that numpy's build process depends on.

By updating to numpy 1.26.4 and pandas 2.2.0, we ensure compatibility with modern Python versions. The runtime.txt file provides an additional safety net by explicitly requesting Python 3.11.9, which is well-tested with all our dependencies.
