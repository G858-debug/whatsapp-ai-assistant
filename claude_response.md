## ANALYSIS
The deployment is failing because the `pydub` module is not listed in `requirements.txt`. Looking at the code, `voice_helpers.py` imports `pydub` (line 7: `from pydub import AudioSegment`) but this dependency is missing from the requirements file. The requirements.txt file has pydub commented out on lines 38-39, which is why the deployment is failing.

## SUMMARY
Fixed the deployment error by uncommenting `pydub==0.25.1` in the requirements.txt file. The module was being imported in `voice_helpers.py` but was commented out in the dependencies list, causing the ModuleNotFoundError. The app needs pydub for audio processing capabilities (converting between audio formats for WhatsApp voice notes).
