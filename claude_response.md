## ANALYSIS
The icalendar module is missing from requirements.txt but is used in services/calendar_service.py for calendar file generation. We need to add this dependency and check for any other related missing dependencies.

## FILES TO CHANGE

### FILE: requirements.txt
```python
# Core Framework
Flask==2.3.3
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# WhatsApp & Communication

## SUMMARY
1. Added icalendar==5.0.10 to requirements.txt under the Utilities section
2. Reviewed calendar_service.py and confirmed all other imports are already covered:
   - typing (built-in)
   - datetime (built-in)
   - pytz (already present)
   - collections (built-in)
   - json (built-in)
   - icalendar (newly added)

The deployment crash should be resolved after installing the missing icalendar dependency. All other required dependencies are properly listed in requirements.txt.
